Static recompilation of **Parasite Eve** built on
[psxrecomp](https://github.com/Alexbeav/psxrecomp) and
[recomp-ui](https://github.com/mstan/recomp-ui).

A native recompilation setup host for the two-disc USA release of Parasite Eve.

## RetComM Launcher

You can run this title **standalone** (release zip + the built-in recomp-ui
Generate & Build flow), or manage installs, updates, ROM/BIOS wiring, and queued
builds more intuitively with
**[RetComM Launcher](https://github.com/TechnicallyComputers/RetComM-Launcher)** —
the Retro Compilation Manager hub for self-compiling recomps.

RetComM checks for updates, rebuilds with existing build data when possible,
shares the portable toolchain used by per-title launchers, and automates
BIOS/ROM/save plumbing so you are not stuck repeating each game’s wizard by hand.

## Legal

You must own the original game and provide both supported disc images. Disc
images under `disc/` are ignored by Git and must never be committed. The
package contains no retail BIOS. Supply a supported USA-region SCPH BIOS from
hardware that you own. The included OpenBIOS image supports setup only.

Default app icon: `assets/psxrecomp.ico` (and `.png` / `.svg`) — RetComM-themed controller mark from `psxrecomp/assets/`. Windows builds embed it via `APP_ICON`.

Optional box art under `launcher_assets/img/` may come from
[libretro-thumbnails](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails)
(`Named_Boxarts`); see `BOXART_SOURCE.txt` when present.

## Quick start (dev)

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
./psxrecomp/tools/ci/build_emitters.sh
python3 psxrecomp/psxrecomp_cli.py generate \
  --config game.toml --project-root . --disc disc/<your>.cue
cmake -S . -B build-release -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-release --target psx-runtime
```

Zip prefix for CI artifacts: `Parasite-Eve-Recompiled`.

## Symbols

Progressive map: `symbols.toml` → `python3 tools/sync_symbols.py` →
`psx_symbols.h` (`PSX_FN_*`). See `psxrecomp/docs/SYMBOLS.md`.

## Framework pins

Submodule gitlinks (`psxrecomp`, optional `recomp-ui`, nested `recomp-net`)
are authoritative. `framework_pins.txt` is an optional scaffold snapshot;
release CI logs SHAs with `record_pins.sh` but builds whatever the gitlinks
resolve to. Bump submodules deliberately — do not float on `main`/`master`
in release CI.

## Platform support

Release 0.3.3 supports Windows x64. Linux and macOS remain in the workflow,
but their release jobs are deferred under the Wave 2 Windows-first exception.

## Multi-disc status

Both supported discs contain the same executable. The setup host validates and
remembers both images. Each disc passed an independent startup test. A natural
in-game disc change still needs a connected manual gameplay test.

## License boundary

Portfolio-owned source, scripts, configuration, and documentation use
GPL-3.0-only. The `LICENSE` file contains the complete terms.

PSXRecomp keeps PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0. Recomp-UI keeps MIT. The GPL
does not cover retail content, generated retail code, artwork, trademarks, or
these separately licensed dependencies.

## About this project

These ports are developed by a hobbyist (a DevSecOps engineer, not a game
programmer) with substantial AI assistance. Every release must pass its
recorded build, package, and gameplay gates. AI writes most of the code, but I
always test it myself before pushing. Bug reports are welcome.
